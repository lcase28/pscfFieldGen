# pscf_field_generator

A tool to generate PSCF initial guess files for spherical or cylindrical morphologies.

## Installation

Add installation instructions.

## Running the tool.

Running the software requires 2 files:

 * A Structure file specifying filenames and particle positions.
 * A PSCF Fortran parameter file.

In order to simplify input for the user, crystallographic and composition information
are taken from a PSCF parameter file. Presently, only parameter files consistent with
the Fortran version of the software are supported.
