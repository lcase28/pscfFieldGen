# Example Files for Initial Guess Generator

This directory tree contains several examples of how to run the guess generator.

Each example has its own directory in which to run.

To run an example, first make sure that you have PSCF installed (both the Fortran
and C++ versions), and have added `pscf_field_generator` to your python path.
When that is done, navigate to the example's directory. Each example has an 
executable called `run` which will generate the KGRID file and use pscf to
convert that to an RGRID format. That executable can be started by entering 

```
./run
```

on the command line. After running an example, the files generated by it can
be removed by entering 

```
./clean
```

on the command line in order to prepare the directory to run again.

## Basis Input

Examples in the directory `basis_input` show how to generate an initial guess
by entering the crystals structure's full basis of particle positions. 
These examples all use the Fortran version of PSCF.
Available morphologies are:

 * 2-Dimensional
    * hexagonally packed cylinders (`hex`)
 * 3-Dimensional
    * BCC Spheres (`bcc')
    * Frank-Kasper A15 Spheres (`a15`)
    * Frank-Kasper sigma Spheres (`sigma`)

## Motif Input

Examples in the directory `motif_input` show how to generate an initial guess
by entering a motif of particles and letting space group symmetry generate
the rest.
These examples all use the Fortran version of PSCF.
Available morphologies are:

 * BCC Spheres (`bcc')
 * Frank-Kasper A15 Spheres (`a15`)
 * Frank-Kasper sigma Spheres (`sigma`)
 * Frank-Kasper c14 Spheres (`c14`)

## Use with PSCF (C++/Cuda)

Examples in the directory `pscfpp_style` illustrate how to use the guess generator
for C++/Cuda version calculations (Until C++ version parameter files become supported).
Available morphologies are:

 * 2-Dimensional
    * hexagonally packed cylinders (`hex`)
 * 3-Dimensional
    * BCC Spheres (`bcc')

In addition to a `run` command to simply generate the density field in KGRID and
RGRID formats using the C++ command file `command`, 
these examples also contain a command `runConvergence` which, by using the `command_long`
command file will generate those density fields as well as converge to a solution.
